## Getting Started

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/nptruong01/Blog.git`
2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the `api` folder and run `npm install` to install the necessary backend dependencies.
3. Configure your database: Set up your database and update the configuration in the `config.js` file.
4. Run the backend: In the `api` folder, start the backend by running `npm start` or `node server.js`.

Now, for the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder: Use `cd client` to move to the client folder.
2. Install frontend dependencies: Run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
3. Run the frontend: Start the frontend by running `npm start`.

By now, you should have both the backend (API) and frontend (client) running. You can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if you've configured it differently).
